== Launch in devcontainer

See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers

FIXME: image:https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode[link=https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-python,title="Open in Remote - Containers"]

== Checkout and build dependencies

This project uses the following library dependencies:

* https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-elab-util
* https://github.com/stefan-hoeck/idris2-sop
* https://github.com/Z-snails/prettier

Since we don't have any dependecy-management yet, they are currently managed via shell script:

[source,bash]
----
pushd dependencies && ./checkout.sh && ./build-and-install.sh && popd
----

== Run main

[source,bash]
----
cd java-support
./run.sh
----
